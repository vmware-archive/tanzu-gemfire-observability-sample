## Overview

This repository contains example dashboards for
[Tanzu Observability by Wavefront](https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability)
as integrated with the Beta 2 release of
[Tanzu GemFire for Kubernetes](http://tgf.docs.pivotal.io/tgf/beta-2).
The dashboards give insight into the operation of
Tanzu GemFire clusters.

## Instantiate a Dashboard

Follow the instructions at
[Collect and View Metrics](https://tgf.docs.pivotal.io/tgf/beta-2/work-with-cluster.html#collect-metrics)
to install a Wavefront Collector and Proxy
and to create a Tanzu GemFire cluster.

Follow the instructions at [Create and Customize Dashboards](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html) to create a dashboard,
and then [Edit the Dashboard JSON](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html#edit-the-dashboard-json) to add the content from one of the samples
in the `dashboards` directory.

Your metrics should propagate to your saved dashboard within a few minutes.
